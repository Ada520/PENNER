  <h2>Wikipedia Ontology Lists</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<b><a href="data/fully-parsed-wikilists-unigram.txt.zip">fully-parsed-wikilists-unigram.txt.zip</a> (2.9 MB) - Wikipedia ontology lists (unigrams)</b>
  		<p>
  			Each line represents an ontology list and is comprised of two fields.
  			The first field is the identifier of the list, containing information about how the list is derived.
  			The second field is a JSON array, containing the items of the list.
  			Only the top 30,000 frequent unigrams are included.
  		</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<b><a href="data/fully-parsed-wikilists-ngram.txt.zip">fully-parsed-wikilists-ngram.txt.zip</a> (6.3 MB) - Wikipedia ontology lists (ngrams)</b>
  		<p>
  			The format is the same as above.
  			Only the top 50,000 frequent n-grams (n up to 5) are included.
  			An unfiltered (much larger) list collection is available upon request.
  			<!--The lists are at ~/consim/py/acl/output/partially-parsed-wikilists-0509.txt -->
  		</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ground Truth Data</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<b><a href="data/gt-classes.txt">gt-classes.txt</a> (80 KB) - Minimum Required Semantic Classes (MRSC)</b>
  		<p>There are 89 classes. Each line represents a class.
  			 The fields are tabular separated. The first field is the class identifier.
  			 The second field is the class name. The remaining fields are the elements in the class.
  		</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<b><a href="data/gt-queries.txt">gt-queries.txt</a> (5 KB) - multifaceted queries</b>
  		<p>There are 150 queries. Each line represents a query.
  			 The fields are tabular separated. The first field is the query (with space-separated terms).
  			 The remaining fields are the MSRC identifiers for the query.
  		</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: to use the ground truth data for evaluation, an alias map or human annotation is required to determine whether a term returned by the system matches any term in one of the MSRCs in the ground truth.
  <!--An alias map used in our evaluation is available upon request.-->
  </p>
  <!--Comment: the alias map is in pickle format (~/consim/py/acl/output/backup/alias_word_map_0717.pickle) and is quite noisy. We use both the alias map as well as human annotation to achieve accurate judgment.-->
